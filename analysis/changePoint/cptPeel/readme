Network Change-point Detection
====================

Requirements
---------------------
dendropy v4.0   :   http://pythonhosted.org/DendroPy/
numpy   :   http://www.numpy.org/
scipy   :   http://scipy.org/


***NOTE: This version of the code has been updated to run with version 4.0 of dendropy and will not work with earlier versions. Tested on version 4.0.2


Before running the code it is recommended that you compile the GHRG code:
cd fitHRG_GPL_Bayes/
make
cd ../consensusHRG_GPL_Bayes/
make


Running the code
---------------------------
This code can be run from the commandline using:

>python runNetworkChangePoint.py [-p "path/to/input/files/"] nodenamesfile windowsize networkfilesequence

runNetworkChangePoint.py [-p â€œlcp/Desktop/release/fitHRG_GPL_Bayes"] nodenamesfile windowsize networkfilesequence

positional arguments:
  nodenamesfile         Input node names file e.g. names.lut
  windowsize            Length of sliding window
  networkfilesequence   Input sequence of network files: e.g. "network1.pairs network2.pairs network3.pairs"

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Path to files (if not in current directory)

Inputs
-----------
the names file is a .lut file of the format:

virtual	real
0	1001
1	123
2	95

the network files are .pairs files in edge list format:

1001	123
1001	95
1001	999

Note:  the nodes that appear in the .pairs file must be integer-valued and appear in the .lut "real" column.  The "virtual" column must be a list of integers starting from 0. 

Outputs
-------------
the output goes in a results.txt file and is the following format:

startwindow1 endwindow1 x x x 
startwindow2 endwindow2 x x x 
startwindow3 endwindow3 x x x 

where startwindow and endwindow is the filename of the start and end networks respectively, the "x"'s correspond to the p-values and an change point is detected if this value is above 0.95.  

note that the window slides on by 1 network in the sequence at a time, unless a change point is detected in which case the window slides to the first network after the change point.
