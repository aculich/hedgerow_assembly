TO BE RE-WRITTEN
  The structure of networks is related to ability of communities to
  maintain function in the face of species extinction. Understanding
  network structure and how it relates to network disassembly,
  therefore, is a priority for system-level conservation biology.  We
  explore the assembly of plant-pollinator communities on native plant
  restorations in the Central Valley of California. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The assembling
  communities are paired with unrestored field margins (controls) and
  mature (non-assembling) hedgerows. We determine whether there are
  change points in the assembly of the communities where the network
  undergoes significant reorganization. We are also ask how are the
  individual species changing their interaction patterns? What does
  this mean for the topology/resilience of the network? We also
  attempted to adapt a financial model to mutualistic networks. Our
  biggest difficulty with this approach was to translate the price
  term to mutualistic systems. We explored a range of approaches, such
  as number of visits a species performs. However, it seems that
  financial systems cannot be easily translated to mutualistic
  systems. In addition, we used a Changing Point Detection Algorithm
  to assess weather the different communities went through a critical
  reorganization on their interaction patterns. We were able to
  identify some changing points in the communities, and also to
  explore some general patterns commonly used to describe ecological
  networks. For example, on the network level, networks become
  increasingly modular and less nested, whereas on the species level,
  species become more specialized, as resources become more reliable.

\subsection*{Study sites and collection methods}
\label{sec:study-sites}

We surveyed plant-pollinator interaction networks of assembling
hedgerows (N=5), as well as in two types of non-assembling communities
to serve as controls: unrestored, weedy field margins (N=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{19}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{XX}\DIFaddend ) and
established hedgerows (greater than 10 years since planting,
N=\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{29}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{XX}\DIFaddend ). The sites were located in the Central Valley of California in
Yolo, Colusa and Solano Counties. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend area is comprised of
intensively managed agriculture -- primarily monocultures of
conventional row crops, vineyards and orchards. Hedgerows \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend planted
along field margins where they do not remove valuable land from
production, and are ca. 3--6m wide and approximately 350m long and
border large (ca.\ 30--hectare) crop fields. Hedgerows consist of
native, perennial, shrub and tree plantings including \textit{Rosa
  californica}, \textit{Cercis occidentalis}, \textit{Ceanothus spp.},
\textit{Heteromeles arbutifolia}, \textit{Sambucus mexicana},
\textit{Eriogonum spp.}, \textit{Baccharis spp.}, \textit{Salvia
  spp}. and others\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{kremen-2015-602, mgonigle-2015-x}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend . The mean distance between monitoring sites was 15
km, and the minimum distance between sites of the same type sampled in
the same year was 2 km.  The entire area surveyed spanned almost 300
km$^2$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and the }\DIFaddend crop fields adjacent to all sites were similarly managed
as intensive, high-input monoculture.

Monitoring began in 2006 and continued through 2015. Sampling of the
assembling hedgerows began the year before the area was restored. For
logistical reasons, no sampling of assembling hedgerows was conducted
in 2010. Sites were sampled between two and five times per year (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Tables S1-S3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Table
XX}\DIFaddend ). In each round of sampling, the order in which sites were sampled
was randomized. Surveys were conducted under sunny conditions when the
temperature was above $21^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and wind speed was below
$2.5$ meters/second.

Flower-visitors to plants in hedgerows and unrestored controls were
netted for one hour of active search time (the timer was paused when
handling specimens). Honeybees (\textit{Apis mellifera}) were not
collected because their abundance is determined largely by the
placement of hives throughout the region by bee-keepers. All other
insect flower visitors that touched the reproductive parts of the
flower were collected; however, here we focus only on wild bees and
syrphids (representing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{49 and 19 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{XX and XX }\DIFaddend percent of records, respectively),
the most abundant and effective pollinators in the system (C. Kremen,
A. Klein and L. Morandin, unpublished data). Bee and syrphid specimens
were identified to species (or morpho-species for some bee specimens
in the genera \textit{Nomada} and \textit{Sphecodes}) by expert
taxonomists.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Quantitative networks were generative for each site through time. To
account for the unequal number of surveys between years, the mean of
the interactions between a pair of plants and pollinators across
surveys within a year was used as a representation of the frequency of
interactions.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \subsection*{Change point analysis}
\subsubsection*{Identifying change points}
We employed a change point detection method \citep{peel2014detecting}
to identify fundamental changes in large-scale pattern of interactions
of plants and pollinators. A change point is caused by a merge, split,
fragmentation or formation of communities (also called modules or
compartments). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Change point detection methods have yet to be
generalized to quantitative networks, so for this analysis we focused
on qualitative (binary) networks. }\DIFdelend Following \cite{peel2014detecting}, we first defined a
probability distribution over the networks using the generalized
hierarchical random graph model (GHRG). The GHRG model is able to
capture both assortative and disassortative community structure
patterns at all scales in the network \citep{peel2014detecting}. A
network $G$ is composed of vertices $V$ and edges $E \subseteq {V × V
}$. The GHRG model decomposes the $N$ vertices into a series of nested
groups, the relationships among which are represented by the
dendrogram $T$.  The tips of $T$ are the vertices of $G$, and the
probability that two vertices $u$ and $v$ connect is given by the
parameter $p_r$. The probability distribution of the network $G$ thus
defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lik}
    P(G|T,{pr}) = p_r^{E_r}(1-p_r)^{N_r-E_r}
\end{equation}
% 
Where $E_r$ is the observed number of edges between vertices with the
common ancestor $r$, and $N_r$ is the total possible edges. 

Using Bayesian posterior inference and techniques from phylogenetic
tree reconstruction, we fit the GHRG model to the networks
\citep{peel2014detecting}. This is accomplished by using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to first sample the posterior
distribution of bipartitions, from which a consensus tree is derived
\citep{peel2014detecting}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ADD NEWMAN PAPER. }\DIFaddend We used $\beta$
distributions with the hyperparameters $\alpha=\beta=1$ to define
priors for $p_r$.

Once the GHRG model has been fit to the networks, we determine whether
a change point occurred between two time slices. To detect a change
point, we compare the fit of two models -- one where a change point
had occurred between two networks, and one where no change occurred --
using posterior Bayes factors. We chose a sliding window of length,
$w$, of four, within which to find change points. Larger windows allow
for more gradual changes, and four was the maximum possible with our
maximum of nine years of data. Lastly, to calculate a $p$-value for
the Bayes factors, we use parametric bootstrapping to numerically
estimate the null distribution \citep{peel2014detecting}. The change
point analysis was carried out using code published online by L\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.~Peel. Analyses we conducted in Python 3.4.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~.Peel.
}\DIFaddend 

We next test whether the change points occurring in maturing hedgerows
were a component of the assembly process or a product of environmental
shifts that lead to network reorganizations in all types of
communities. We model the number of change points as successes and the
total number of years each site was sampled as trails, and use a
generalized linear model with Binomial error to test whether the
probability of a change point occurring varied by site type.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For the
non-assembling hedgerows and weedy field margins, only sites with five
or greater years of sampling was included in this analysis. All
statistical analysis were conducted in R 3.2.3 \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{R}}%DIFAUXCMD
.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend To further elucidate the nature of the change points, we examine the
characteristics of the species that contributed the reorganization of
interactions. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Some species remain in relatively similar network
positions through time, whereas others are more variable in their role
and thus contribute more strongly to network reorganization.  We test
the that more persistent species with the highest degree are the most
stable in their network

were assembling via preferential attachment. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{We calculate species persistence as the
proportion of the surveys a
pollinator was observed. Species observed consistently within and between years are thus maximally persistent. Weighted species degree
is calculated from interaction observations observed in more extensive
data-set from Yolo County (approx.~ 18000 interaction records) that
included both the data included in this study and additional data from
sites where we collected flower visitors using the same methods

To represent the the variability of species within networks, we
computed the coefficient of variation of weighted closeness at each
site through time. Closeness describes the centrality of a
species in
the network by calculating path lengths to other vertices (species)
in
the graph. We used linear mixed models to test whether the variability
of species
closeness values was related to the persistence or degree
of that species \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{lme4, lmetest}}%DIFAUXCMD
. We included random effects for
species, as well as site. We focused on the pollinator species because
the hedgerow flowers are planted and thus are not directly
assembling. Because degree and persistence were strongly correlated,
($\rho = 0.84$, $p$-value $<$ $2*10^{-16}$), each explanatory variable
was included in the model separately. Because a linear increase in
closeness, as might be expected with assembly by preferential
attachment, would lead to a high variability in closeness scores, we

\DIFaddend \subsection*{Network structure}
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend The changing points in network structure may contribute to the
reorganization of the assembling networks into predictable interaction
patterns. Pollination networks exhibit two main \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{topologies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{structural patterns }\DIFaddend ---
modularity \citep[e.g.,][]{Olesen2007} and nestedness
\citep[e.g.,][]{Bascompte2006, Bascompte2003}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Modular }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In modular }\DIFaddend community
interactions are insular, occurring within separate groups or
``modules'' more often than between modules. Communities in the
network may fragment as the network assembles, enhancing
modularity. Conversely, nested networks are like pyramid of
interactions, where there are some species that interact with many
species, other species that interact with a subset of those species,
and so on. If species entering the network tend to interact with the
generalist base of the network pyramid\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(i.e., preferential
attachment), }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend nestedness would increase
through time. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Lastly}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Alternatively}\DIFaddend , if the network is accumulating specialist %DIF >  I removed the lastly because I thought it was confusing, like a third point besides Mod and Nestedness. 
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{species or if }\DIFaddend species \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or species }\DIFdelend are beginning to limit their interaction niche
breath as the network assembles, this would lead to an increase in the
network-level specialization \citep{bluthgen-2006-9} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and nestedness would decrease
through time}\DIFaddend . To test whether
network modularity, nestedness or specialization changed linearly with
assembly, we used linear mixed models with the descriptive network
metrics as the response variable, year of assembly as the explanatory
variable, and random effects of site and year.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We use NODF (weighted or unweighted) to evaluate network nestedness
\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{nodf}}%DIFAUXCMD
. NODF evaluates whether species with fewer partners
interact with subsets of partners with which more connected species
interact \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{nodf}}%DIFAUXCMD
. To estimate modularity, we use a hierarchical
clustering algorithm \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Newman2004, igraph}}%DIFAUXCMD
.  We calculated
standardized $z$-scores so that nestedness and modularity metrics
could be compared between communities. The $z$-scores were calculated
by generating an ensemble of $999$ randomly assembled communities,
subtracting the mean of the statistic calculated across these
communities from the observed value, and then dividing by the standard
deviation. To assemble random communities, we reshuffled the
interactions between species but fixed the total number of
interactions, species and the distribution of the interaction
frequencies \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Galeano2009}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Lastly, Network specialization was
measured using H2, which estimate the deviation of the observed
interaction frequency between plants and pollinators from a null
expectation where all partners interact in proportion to their
abundances \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{bluthgen-2006-9}}%DIFAUXCMD
. It ranges from 0 for generalized
networks to 1 for specialized networks.

\subsubsection*{Identifying change points}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The majority ($76\%$) of the sites tests underwent at least one
significant reorganization of interactions (Fig.~
\ref{fig:changePoints}). There were no consistent trends as to when
change points occurred within assembling hedgerows or across all sites,
except many site had changing points between year 2009 and 2011 (Fig.~
\ref{fig:changePoints}). In California, 2011 marked the beginning of a
multi year drought. In the assembling hedgerows were not sampled in
2010, so disentangling whether the changing points are due to skipping
a year of assembly or the drought is not impossible.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{All five of the assembling hedgerows experienced changing points,
whereas only $40\%$ and $81\%$ of non-assembling hedgerows and field
margins, respectively, underwent significant interaction
reorganizations. Assembling hedgerows experienced significantly more
changing points than the non-assembling networks (difference in the
odds ratios between assembling and non-assembling networks, $3.316$,
$95\%$ CI $[1.314, 8.572]$, $p$-value= $0.0117$). Network assembly
following restoration is thus punctuated by more interaction
reorganizations than would be expected by environmental shifts that
would effect assembling and non-assembling networks equally.
