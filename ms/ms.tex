  TO BE RE-WRITTEN
  The structure of networks is related to ability of communities to
  maintain function in the face of species extinction. Understanding
  network structure and how it relates to network disassembly,
  therefore, is a priority for system-level conservation biology.  We
  explore the assembly of plant-pollinator communities on native plant
  restorations in the Central Valley of California.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

%% introduce mutualisms, restoration, network assembly
Global change has created a severe biodiversity crisis, and as species
are lost, so are their interactions \citep{dunn2009sixth,
  barnosky2011has}. Because mutualistic interactions are essential for
maintaining the diversity their component guilds of species, these
systems are particularly at risk from coextinction cascades. The
nature of these cascades will depend on the interaction patterns
within a community \citep{Memmott2004, Rezende2007,
  Bascompte2009}. Recovering the lost biodiversity and interactions
through ecological restoration has become increasingly imperative, and
a key restoration aim is to facilitate assembly of robust interaction
networks \citep{menz-2010-4}. We know little, however, about how to
re-assemble interacting communities through restoration, or the
process of ecological network assembly more generally.

%% most people think network assemble via preferential attachment, and
%% there is some evidence of that. (other studies on mutualisms?)
The most widely explored mechanism of network assembly, preferential
attachment \citep{barabasi1999emergence}, predicts that a new species
is more likely to interact with species that are already
well-connected \citep[''the rich-get-richer''
principle,][]{barabasi1999emergence}. In pollination systems --- a
particularly ubiquitous mutualism \citep{ollerton-2011-321,
  klein-2007-303} --- some studies have found support for this
mechanism of assembly. Investigating the day-to-day, temporal assembly
of a plant-pollinator network within a season, \cite{Olesen2008} found
that new species tended to interact with already well-connected
species, potentially because these species are either more abundant or
more temporally persistent \citep{Olesen2008}. In addition, using a
space-for-time substitution to study primary succession along a
glacier foreland, \cite{albrecht2010plant} found some indication
assembly occurred through preferential attachment. Network nestedness,
a pattern of interactions where a generalist core interacts with both
specialist and generalist species, increased as the community aged
\citep{albrecht2010plant}. Increasing nestedness could result from
preferential attachment process where specialist species attach to the
well-connected, generalist core.  % In addition,
% non-successional temporal dynamics also suggest a stable core of
% generalists persists despite high turnover of peripheral species
% \citep{fang2012relative, diaz2010changes, alarcon2008year}.

%% there are other ways to assemble that are not preferentia;
%% attchment, particularly vis big reorganizations of interactions
In contrast to the ordered network build-up described by preferential
attachment, significant reorganizations of interactions can punctuate
assembly \citep{peel2014detecting}. Such significant reorganizations
of interactions, or changing points, are observed in social networks
responding to abrupt shifts in the behavior of interactors
\citep{peel2014detecting}.  In ecological communities, such shifts may
occur if, as new species colonize, resident species change their
interaction partners to optimize their foraging effort. In
plant-pollinator communities, theory predicts pollinators optimize
their use of floral resources to reduce interspecific competition and
improve resource-use efficiency \citep{pyke1984optimal,
  valdovinos2010consequences, valdovinos2013adaptive,
  albrecht2010plant, Bluthgen2007}. No studies, however, have examined
whether changing points occur during ecological network assembly, and
how these changes relate to the behavior of the interactors.

%% restoration
Understanding network assembly is particularly relevant to ecological
restoration, which is essentially 'applied succession'
\citep[e.g.,]{parker1997scale}. In pollination systems, the time since
an area was restored has been shown to affect the structure of
networks \citep{forup-2008-742, forup2008restoration,
  devoto2012understanding}, suggesting interactions are evolving as
the community develops. Understanding the mechanisms of network
assembly will help to guide community restoration.

%% restoration of ecosystem services is really important, particularly
%% in ag. but ag is a bad place for pollinators
Facilitating effective restoration of networks is especially
imperative in areas where species interactions provide essential
ecosystem services, such as crop pollination. In intensively managed
agricultural landscapes, the demand for pollination services is the
greatest \citep{kremen-2008-10}. However, honey bees, managed
extensively around the world to provide crop pollination, are in
global decline \citep{neumann-2010-1, van-engelsdorp-2009-e6481}. In
addition, native pollinators, which are capable of providing
sufficient crop pollination \citep{kremen-2002-16816,
  winfree-2007-1105, kremen-2004-1109}, are in short supply because
these landscapes make poor habitats for pollinator populations
\citep{kremen-2002-16816}. To ensure provision the continued provision
of ecosystem services and curb biodiversity loss, effective
restoration of pollinators and their interactions in agricultural
landscapes is critical.

%% hedgerows!!  
To promote pollinator services in agriculture, farmers are
increasingly turning to the habitat restoration technique of planting
strips of native plants along farm edges (hedgerows) to help provide
habitat for pollinators without removing arable land from
production. Hedgerows augment the richness, abundance and trait
diversity of pollinators in agricultural
landscapes\citep{morandin-2013-829, mgonigle-2015-x, kremen-2015-602,
  ponisio2015farm}. In addition, hedgerows promote the persistence and
colonization of floral resource specialists
\citep{mgonigle-2015-x}. Little is known, however, about the assembly
of the network following hedgerow restoration.

Using a long-term dataset of plant-pollinator communities assembling
following hedgerow restoration in the highly simplified and
intensively managed agricultural landscape of California's Central
Valley, we explore the process of network development. We first
determine whether the mechanism underlying network assembly is a
smooth build up of interactions as would be predicted by preferential
attachment, or punctuated by significant reorganizations of
interactions (i.e., network changing points). Even with changing
points in interaction organization, networks could still be assembling
via preferential attachment if the network reorganizations were
primarily driven the by peripheral, temporally variable species while
a stable, well-connected core of species still persists. We test
whether the species are most variable in their network position ---
and thus important contributors network reorganizations --- are less
persistent and connected species. To further explore the mechanisms
underlying the temporal dynamics in the networks, we examine patterns
in the species and interaction temporal turnover. Lastly, we
investigate whether networks are assembling toward predictable
interaction patterns, and the ramifications for the robustness of the
networks to species extinction and cascading perturbations.

%% objectives
% 1) Are hedgerows assembling by preferential attachment, or are there
% more abrupt reorganizations of network structure?
% 2) Who are the species responsible for interaction reorganizations?
% how to incorporate this? 
% 3) Are the changing points a product of turnover in species
% composition, or are more substantial changes in the verticles of the
% networks?
% 4) Is the structure of interactions changing? Does this change the
% robustness of the network to species extinction and/or perturbation?

\section*{Materials \& Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection*{Study sites and collection methods}
\label{sec:study-sites}

We surveyed plant-pollinator interaction networks of assembling
hedgerows (N=5), as well as in two types of non-assembling communities
to serve as controls: unrestored, weedy field margins (N=19) and
established hedgerows (greater than 10 years since planting,
N=29). The sites were located in the Central Valley of California in
Yolo, Colusa and Solano Counties. This area is comprosed of
intensively managed agriculture -- primarily monocultures of
conventional row crops, vineyards and orchards. Hedgerows we planted
along field margins where they do not remove valuable land from
production. Plantings are between are ca. 3--6 m wide and
approximately 350 m long, bordering large (ca.\ 30--hectare) crop
fields. Hedgerows consist of native, perennial, shrub and tree
plantings including \textit{Rosa californica}, \textit{Cercis
  occidentalis}, \textit{Ceanothus spp.}, \textit{Heteromeles
  arbutifolia}, \textit{Sambucus mexicana}, \textit{Eriogonum spp.},
\textit{Baccharis spp.}, \textit{Salvia spp}. and others
\citep{kremen-2015-602, mgonigle-2015-x}. The mean distance between
monitoring sites was 15 km, and the minimum distance between sites of
the same type sampled in the same year was 2 km.  The entire area
surveyed spanned almost 300 km$^2$. The crop fields adjacent to all
sites were similarly managed as intensive, high-input monoculture.

Monitoring began in 2006 and continued through 2015. Surveys of the
assembling hedgerows began the year before the area was restored. For
logistical reasons, no sampling of assembling hedgerows was conducted
in 2010. Sites were sampled between two and five times per year
(Tables S1-S3). In each round of sampling, the order in which sites
were sampled was randomized. Surveys were conducted under sunny
conditions when the temperature was above $21^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and
wind speed was below $2.5$ meters/second.

Flower-visitors to plants in hedgerows and unrestored controls were
netted for one hour of active search time (the timer was paused when
handling specimens). Honeybees (\textit{Apis mellifera}) were not
collected because their abundance is determined largely by hive
placement by bee-keepers. All other insect flower visitors that
touched the reproductive parts of the flower were collected; however,
here we focus only on wild bees and syrphids --- the most abundant and
effective pollinators in the system (representing 49 and 19 percent of
records, respectively, C.~Kremen, A.~Klein and L.~Morandin,
unpublished data). Bee and syrphid specimens were identified to
species (or morpho-species for some bee specimens in the genera
\textit{Nomada} and \textit{Sphecodes}) by expert taxonomists.

Quantitative networks were generated for each site through time. To
account for the unequal number of surveys between years (Tables
S1-S3), we use the mean of the interactions between a pair of plants
and pollinators across surveys within a year to represent intearction
frequency.

\subsection*{Change point analysis}
\subsubsection*{Identifying change points}
We employed a change point detection method \citep{peel2014detecting}
to identify fundamental reorganizations in large-scale interaction
patterns. A change point is caused by a merge, split, fragmentation or
formation of communities (also called modules or compartments). Change
point detection methods have yet to be generalized to quantitative
networks, so for this analysis we focused on qualitative (binary)
networks. Following \cite{peel2014detecting}, we first defined a
probability distribution over the networks using the generalized
hierarchical random graph model (GHRG). The GHRG model is able to
capture both assortative and disassortative community structure
patterns at all scales in the network \citep{peel2014detecting}. A
network $G$ is composed of vertices $V$ and edges $E \subseteq {V × V
}$. The GHRG model decomposes the $N$ vertices into a series of nested
groups, the relationships among which are represented by the
dendrogram $T$. The tips of $T$ are the vertices of $G$, and the
probability that two vertices $u$ and $v$ connect is given by the
parameter $p_r$. The probability distribution of the network $G$ thus
defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:lik}
  P(G|T,{pr}) = p_r^{E_r}(1-p_r)^{N_r-E_r}
\end{equation}
% 
Where $E_r$ is the observed number of edges between vertices with the
common ancestor $r$, and $N_r$ is the total possible edges.

Using Bayesian posterior inference and techniques from phylogenetic
tree reconstruction, we fit the GHRG model to the networks
\citep{peel2014detecting}. This is accomplished by using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure to first sample the posterior
distribution of bipartitions, from which a consensus tree is derived
\citep{peel2014detecting}. We use $\beta$ distributions with the
hyperparameters $\alpha=\beta=1$ to define priors for $p_r$.

Once the GHRG model has been fit to the networks, we determine whether
a change point occurred between two time slices. To detect a change
point, we compare the fit of two models --- one where a change point
occurred between two networks, and one where no change occurred ---
using posterior Bayes factors. We chose a sliding window of length,
$w$, of four, within which to find change points. Larger windows allow
for more gradual changes, and four was the maximum possible with our
maximum of nine years of data. Lastly, to calculate a $p$-value for
the Bayes factors, we use parametric bootstrapping to numerically
estimate the null distribution \citep{peel2014detecting}. We emploied
code published online by L.~Peel for the change point
analysis. Analyses we conducted in Python 3.4.

We next test whether the change points occurring in maturing hedgerows
were a component of the assembly process or a product of environmental
shifts that lead to network reorganizations in all types of
communities. We model the number of change points as successes and the
total number of years each site was sampled as trails, and use a
generalized linear model with Binomial error to test whether the
probability of a change point occurring varied by site type. We used
standard techniques to determine whether the assumptions of the models
were met for this and all subsequent models. For the non-assembling
hedgerows and weedy field margins, only sites with five or greater
survey years were included in this analysis. All statistical analysis
were conducted in R 3.2.3 \citep{R}.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics of species that contribute to change
  points}

To further elucidate the nature of the change points, we examine the
characteristics of the species that contributed interaction
reorganization. Some species remain in relatively similar network
positions through time, whereas others are more variable in their role
and thus contribute more strongly to network reorganization. We test
the that more persistent species with the highest degree are the most
stable in their network position, as would be expected is the networks
were assembling via preferential attachment.

We calculate species persistence as the proportion of surveys a plant
or pollinator is observed. Species observed consistently within and
between years are thus maximally persistent. Weighted species degree
is calculated from interaction observations from an extensive dataset
from Yolo County (approx.~18000 interaction records) that included
both the data included in this study and additional data from sites
where we collected flower visitors using the same methods
\citep{mgonigle-2015-x, ponisio2015farm}. To represent network
position variability, we computed the coefficient of variation of
weighted closeness at each site through time. Closeness describes the
centrality of a species in the network by calculating path lengths to
other vertices (species) in the graph. We use linear mixed models to
test whether the species closeness variability (log) is related to the
persistence or degree of that species \citep{lme4, lmetest}. We
included random effects for species, as well as site. Because the
degree and persistence of pollinators were strongly correlated, ($\rho
= 0.84$, $p$-value $<$ $2*10^{-16}$), we include each explanatory
variable in the model separately. Plant degree and persistent were not
significantly correlated, but we use the same models as we did for the
pollinators for consistency. A linear increase in closeness, as might
be expected with assembly by preferential attachment, would also lead
to a high variability in closeness scores, so we test whether
closeness increases through time.

\subsection*{Species and interaction turnover}

Reorganizations of network structure can be the result of species
turnover or species changing their interaction partners (i.e.,
re-wiring). To better understand the mechanisms underlying the
temporal dynamics of the assembling networks, we examined patterns of
pollinator species and interaction turnover. Assembling networks may
have higher rates of species turnover than non-assembling communities
because new species are colonizing and establishing themselves
\citep{mgonigle-2015-x}. Similarly, if pollinators try to maximize
their foraging efficiency based on the species present, interactions
may turnover more quickly than in established communities.

To estimate the temporal species and interaction turnover, we use an
approach similar to calculating spatial $\beta$-diversity. Instead of
calculating the variation in community composition across sites within
a year, however, we estimated turnover across years at a site. We
first calculated the pairwise dissimilarity of species and
interactions between years within each site using a dissimilarity
estimator that incorporates abundances, while also accounting for
unobserved records \citep{chao-2005-148}. Dissimilarity estimates can
be affected by the total number of species and individuals sampled at
a site \citep[e.g.,][]{ponisio2015farm}. For example, the probability
that two sites do not share any species is higher when there are few
individuals at those sites. Following \cite{ponisio2015farm}, we use
null models that constrained species richness to estimate the
deviation of the observed dissimilarity from that which would be
expected under a random community assembly process. With the corrected
dissimilarity values, we then calculated the multivariate dispersion
of community composition across years \citep{anderson-2011-19}. In
order to test whether assembling hedgerows had more turnover of
species and interactions than non-assembling communities, the species
and interaction temporal turnover estimates were response variables in
a linear mixed models with site type as an explanatory variable along
with random effects for both year and site \citep{lme4, lmetest}.

Though species may turnover across years, some groups of species may
essentially replace each other if they fill similar roles in the
network. At non-assembling communities, species turnover may
overestimate the temporal changes in the networks if the interactions
occurring in one year are similar to those in the next year when they
are weighted by the similarity of their constituent species. We
develope a method examine the temporal turnover of interactions
weighted based on their similarity. We followed \cite{ahn2010link}
algorithm to hierarchically cluster all the interactions (edges)
across sites and years based on their similarity, and build a
dendrogram. The interaction similarity is based how may plants and
pollinators (vertices) two edges share \citep{ahn2010link,
  kalinka2011linkcomm}. The more species edges shared in common, the
shorter the branch length between them on the dendrogram.  We next
calculated the temporal turnover of interactions weighted by their
similarity, as approximated by ``phylogenetic'' distance
\citep{graham2008phylogenetic, picante-2010-1463}. When then use
linear models to test whether the weighted turnover of interactions
varied between assembling and non-assembling networks \citep{lme4,
  lmetest}.

\section*{Temporal changes in interaction patterns}

\subsection*{Network structure}
Any changing points in network structure may contribute to the
reorganization of the assembling networks into predictable interaction
patterns. Pollination networks exhibit two main structural patterns
--- modularity \citep[e.g.,][]{Olesen2007} and nestedness
\citep[e.g.,][]{Bascompte2006, Bascompte2003}. In modular networks,
interactions are insular, occurring within separate groups or
``modules'' more often than between modules. Communities in the
network may fragment as the network assembles, enhancing
modularity. Conversely, nested networks are like a pyramid of
interactions, where there are some species that interact with many
species, other species that interact with a subset of those species,
and so on. If species entering the network tend to interact with the
generalist base of the network pyramid (i.e., via preferential
attachment), nestedness would increase through time. The connectance
--- the proportion of observed out of possible interactions --- is
also expected to increase as species preferentially attach to the
core. The network specialization may also change as the community
assembles. If specialist species colonize the network or species begin
to limit their interaction niche breath as the network assembles,
network-level specialization will increase \citep{bluthgen-2006-9}.

To evaluate network nestedness, we used the estimator weighted NODF
citep{nodf}. NODF evaluates whether species with fewer partners
interact with subsets of partners with which more connected species
interact \citep{nodf}. To estimate modularity, we use a hierarchical
clustering algorithm \citep{Newman2004, igraph}.  We calculated
standardized $z$-scores so that nestedness and modularity metrics
could be compared between communities. The $z$-scores were calculated
by generating an ensemble of $999$ randomly assembled communities,
subtracting the mean of the statistic calculated across these
communities from the observed value, and then dividing by the standard
deviation. To assemble random communities, we reshuffled the
interactions between species but fixed the total number of
interactions, species and interaction frequency distributions
\citep{Galeano2009}. We evaluate network specialization with the
metric H2, which estimate the deviation of the observed interaction
frequency between plants and pollinators from a null expectation where
all partners interact in proportion to their abundances
\citep{bluthgen-2006-9}. It ranges from zero for generalized networks
to one for specialized networks.

To test whether network modularity, nestedness, connectance or
specialization changed linearly with assembly, we use linear mixed
models with the descriptive network metrics as the response variable,
year of assembly as the explanatory variable, and random effects of
site and year. The number of species in a network affects affects the
patterns of interaction possible, so we also examined the change in
plant and pollinator species richness through time. We employ
generalized linear mixed models with Poisson error to model
richness. We scaled explanatory variables.


\subsection*{Network robustness}
Lastly, we test the changes in interaction patterns associated with
network assembly affect the robustness of the network to species loss
and to cascading perturbations. Following \cite{Memmott2004}, we
simulate plant species extinction and the subsequent extinction
cascades of pollinator species. Because the reproduction of plant
species if facilitated by active restoration efforts, it is unlikely
the extinction of pollinator species would affect plant populations in
the hedgerows. However, plants ceasing to bloom, for example in
response to drought, will likely affect the pollinators that depend on
them. We eliminate plants species based on their degree or abundance,
and the number of pollinators that secondarily went extinct is
calculated. The area below the extinction curve is an estimate of
network robustness \citep{bipartite}.

We also explored how the robustness to cascading perturbations changed
as community assembled, using algebraic connectivity --- the second
smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix
\citep{fiedler1973algebraic} --- as a proxy for network robustness
(Gaiarsa et al., submitted). Algebraic connectivity relates to how
difficult it is to turn a network into completely disconnected groups
of vertices, or species \citep{costa2007characterization} --- the
larger the algebraic connectivity, the more robust a network is to
cascading perturbations (Gaiarsa et al., submitted), and the harder it
is to break the community into isolated groups of species.

\section*{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Over eight years and $747$ samples, we collected and identified
$19,547$ wild bees and syrphids comprising $173$ species from $50$
genera. We observed $1,521$ unique interactions between plants and
pollinators.

\subsection*{Change point analysis}
\subsubsection*{Identifying change points}

The majority ($76\%$) of the sites underwent at least one significant
interaction reorganization (Fig.~\ref{fig:changePoints}).  All five of
the assembling hedgerows experienced changing points, whereas only
$40\%$ and $81\%$ of non-assembling hedgerows and field margins,
respectively, underwent significant interaction
reorganizations. Assembling hedgerows experienced significantly more
changing points than the non-assembling networks (estimate of the
difference in the odds ratios between assembling and non-assembling
networks, $3.316$, $95\%$ CI $[1.314, 8.572]$, $p$-value=
$0.0117$). Network assembly following restoration is thus punctuated
by more interaction reorganizations than would be expected by
environmental shifts that would effect assembling and non-assembling
networks equally.

\subsubsection*{Characteristics of species that contribute to change
  points}

In contradiction to the predictions of assembly by preferential
attachment, both pollinator persistence and degree were positively
related to network position variability (estimate of the slope of
closeness variability and persistence $\pm$ standard error of the
estimate, $0.653 \pm 0.225$, $p$-value=$0.009$; slope of closeness
variability and degree, $0.008 \pm 0.002$, $p$-value='$0.002$). In
addition, plant persistence and degree were not significantly related
to network position variability (estimate of the slope of closeness
variability and persistence $\pm$ standard error of the estimate,
$-2.063 \pm 3.091$, $p$-value=$0.5$; slope of closeness variability
and degree, $0.0018 \pm 0.002$, $p$-value=$0.3$). The variability of
species network position was not the result of closeness linearly
increasing through time, and, in fact, plant and pollinator closeness
decreased slightly through time (Fig.~S1, estimate of the slope of
closeness through time $\pm$ standard error of the estimate,
pollinators: $-0.0003 \pm 0.00005$, $p$-value=$2.7*10^{-12}$; plants
$-0.007 \pm 0.001$, $p$-value=$1.4*10^{-6}$). Through statistically
significant, the slopes are so slight they may not me biologically
significant.

\subsection*{Species and interaction turnover}
The rates of species and interaction temporal turnover similar across
assembling hedgerows, non-assembling hedgerows and field margins,
though mature hedgerows has marginally significantly less species
turnover than field margins (estimate $\pm$ standard error of the
estimate of the difference in turnover between field margins and
mature hedgerows, $-0.0498 \pm 0.026$, $p$-value=$0.058$). When
interactions where weighted by their similarity, both assembling and
mature hedgerows had higher rates of turnover than field margins
(estimate $\pm$ standard error of the estimate of the difference in
turnover between field margins and assembling hedgerows, $0.115 \pm
0.027$, $p$-value=$0.0002$; field margins and mature hedgerows, $0.082
\pm 0.024$, $p$-value=$0.002$). The weighted interaction turnover at
assembling hedgerows, however, was not significantly higher than in
non-assembling, mature hedgerows.


\section*{Temporal changes in interaction patterns}
\subsection*{Network structure}
Network nestedness significantly increased with assembly (estimate of
the slope of nestedness through time $\pm$ standard error of the
estimate, $1.834 \pm 0.6142$, $p$-value=$0.022$, Fig.~\ref{fig:baci}).
Modularity decreased (Fig.~\ref{fig:baci}), though the slope was not
significantly different from zero (estimate of the slope of modularity
through time $\pm$ standard error of the estimate, $-0.524$ $\pm$
$0.295$, $p$-value=$0.124$). Connectance decreased as the community
assembled (Fig.~\ref{fig:baci}, estimate of the slope of connectance
through time $\pm$ standard error of the estimate, $-0.0434$ $\pm$
$0.0152$, $p$-value=$0.03$). In contrast, specialization remained
constant (estimate of the slope of specialization through time $\pm$
standard error of the estimate, $0.003$ $\pm$ $0.015$,
$p$-value=$0.827$).

Both plant and pollinator species richness increased through time
(Fig.~\ref{fig:baci}, estimate of the slope of richness through time
$\pm$ standard error of the estimate, pollinators: $0.193$ $\pm$
$0.0729$, $p$-value=$0.008$; plants:$0.212$ $\pm$ $0.0653$,
$p$-value=$0.001$). Pollinator species are colonizing and persisting
at the assembling hedgerows. Though some new plant species may
eshablish themselves in the hedgerows, because the plant species
richness is based on the flowers in the network and not the presence
of a plant at a site, the increase in plant richness is likely due to
plants attracting more visitors as they offer better rewards.

\subsection*{Network robustness}
Assembly did not effect the robustness of the networks to species
extinction when species where removed incrementally by degree
(estimate of the slope of robustness through time $\pm$ standard error
of the estimate, $6*10^{-5} \pm 4*10^{-3}$, $p$-value=$0.987$) or
abundance ($0.001 \pm 0.003$, $p$-value=$0.65$, Fig.~\ref{fig:rob}).

In contrast, the robustness of networks to cascading perturbations, as
measured by the algebraic connectivity of the network, increased as
the network assembled (estimate of the slope of robustness through
time $\pm$ standard error of the estimate, $0.6814 \pm 0.272$,
$p$-value=$0.042$, Fig.~\ref{fig:rob}).

\section*{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

We show that the temporal assembly of plant-pollinator networks
following restoration is a highly dynamic process where interactions
often undergo significant reorganizations. These network organizations
are unlikely to be a product of environmental forces alone because the
network changing points in non-assembling communities are less
frequent, and there are few consistent trends in when change points
occurred across all sites. Several sites had changing points between
year 2009 and 2011 (Fig.~\ref{fig:changePoints}). In California, 2011
marked the beginning of a multi-year drought. In the assembling
hedgerows were not sampled in 2010, so disentangling whether the
changing points are due to skipping a year of assembly or the drought
is not possible. Interestingly, most of the assembling hedgerows did
not undergo a significant interaction reorganization immediately the
hedgerow was planted (i.e., the transition from weedy field margin to
hedgerow). This result is consistent with the finding that in our
study system, hedgerow restoration takes several years to have a
significant impact on the plant-pollinator communities (Kremen and
M'Gonigle, in prep).

Given that several changing points in network organization occurred
during assembly, we next explored the species most likely responsible
for the shifts in interaction patterns. Based on a preferential
attachment-like mechanism, we expect that the most persistent and high
degree species would remain stable in the network core during
assembly, and would thus contribute the least to the changing points
in network organization. Surprisingly however, we encountered the
opposite: the species that were most variable in their network
position and thus contributed most to network reorganizations where
species with the highest degrees (i.e., most generalized) and
persistence. For example, the five most ubiquitous species in our
study landscape --- \textit{Halictus ligatus}, \textit{Halictus
  tripartitus}, \textit{Lasioglossum (Dialictus) incompletum}, and
\textit{Toxomerus marginatus} --- were the only species that changed
what module (i.e., community), and they were also present in across
years in all of the assembling hedgerows. Because species degree and
persistence were strongly correlated, it is difficult to disentangle
the causal mechanism for why species with those characteristics are so
variable in their network position. Generalized species may be able to
better exploit the limited floral resources in the intensively managed
agriculture landscape, and thus also most persistent. More persistent
species also have longer phenologies, so they have the opportunity to
visit many different flowers, resulting in a higher degree. Either
way, our result suggests that adaptable species can change their
network position to utilize the most advantageous floral resources
available, which may depend on the other pollinator species that are
present and the state of the floral resource. Thus given the
opportunity and ability to use different resources, species will often
change their network positions.

Interestingly, though assembling hedgerows had more network
reorganizations than non-assembling communities, pollinator species
and interaction turnover occurred at similar rates across site
types. Only when interactions were weighted by their uniqueness did
assembling hedgerows have higher turnover than non-assembling field
margins. This is likely because though species and interactions are
turning over at the field margins, but pollinator species and
interactions that fill similar roles in the network are replacing each
other. In contrast, at the assembling hedgerows, unique interactions
are turning over as the networks continually
reorganize. Non-assembling mature hedgerow communities, however, had
similar rates of weighted interaction turnover as assembling hedgerows
but also the lowest species turnover. Pollinator communities at mature
hedgerows may be generally more stable, but rare and/or specialized
pollinators could generate this pattern if they entered a community,
formed interactions with plants that did not previously share
pollinators, but did not have high persistence. ANYTHING ELSE? mature
hedgerows are important for conservation or rare species? Maybe? 

The frequent changing points in network organization, dynamic nature
of the location of species in networks, and turnover of species and
interactions all point to an assembly mechanism other than
preferential attachment. Nestedness did increase with years post
restoration, as would be expected if colonizing, specialist species
attached to a central, generalist core \cite{albrecht2010plant}. With
preferential attachment, however, we would also expect connectance and
specialization to increase, and we found no such trends. The stable
level of network-level specialization through the assembly process may
be due to the increased colonization of specialized species
\citep{mgonigle-2015-x} accompanied by an increase in the diet breath
of resident species. This would be expected if resident species were
able to minimize their foraging time by expanding their diet breath as
plant diversity increases with hedgerow maturation \citep{Waser1996,
  pyke1984optimal, Bluthgen2007, albrecht2010plant}. Such a change in
pollinator behavior would also explain the increase in network
nestedness.

The changes in network patterns with assembly also increased the
robustness of the networks to cascading perturbations -- providing
further evidence that hedgerows are valuable tool for promoting
species conservation and ecosystem provision in agricultural areas
\citep{mgonigle-2015-x, ponisio2015farm, kremen-2015-602}. Because the
vulnerability of the network to cascading perturbations, as measured by
algebraic connectivity, is correlated with species richness, the
increase and plant and pollinator richness following restoration is at
least partially responsible for enhancing network robustness to
cascading effects. The relationship between diversity and stability in
networks has been the subject of considerable debate
\citep[e.g.,][]{may1972will, pimm1984complexity,
  montoya2006ecological}. Our results provides one of the few
empirical examples of how restoring species diversity contributes to
enhancing network stability. Though these hedgerows were designed to
promote floral resources across the growing season and not
specifically to promote any specific network properties
\citep{menz-2010-4}, the pollinators assembled into resilient
interaction patterns. With prior knowledge of the floral preferences
of pollinators, future restoration efforts may also be able to
incorporate promoting network stability into planning efforts
\citep{mgonigle2016tool}

Interestingly, however, the robustness of hedgerow communities to
species loss did not change with assembly. This is particularly
surprising given the observed increase in nestedness, which is often
associated with an enhanced in robustness to extinction
\citep{Memmott2004}. It may be that assembling hedgerows have not yet
reached a sufficient level of nestedness to realize its
benefits. Nestedness of the assembling hedgerows, however, did not
asymptote within the eight years following restoration that the sites
were surveyed, so hedgerow networks may eventually reach sufficient
levels of nestedness to gain the robustness advantage.

Plant-pollinator networks in general are highly dynamic, with high
turnover of species and interactions both within and between seasons
\citep{Burkle2011}. Though our non-assembling communities experience
fewer network reorganizations than the assembling hedgerows, $82\%$ of
field margins and $40\%$ of mature hedgerows underwent at least one
changing point in network structure. Pollinators are also highly
opportunistic \citep{petanidou-2008-564, Vazquez2005b,
  albrecht2010plant}, though trait complementarity such as tongue
length and corolla depth impose some biophysical limits to the
interactions between plants and pollinators
\citep{Vazquez2009evaluating, Vazquez2009, Stang2009, Stang2006,
  Santamaria2007}. Such opportunism may buffer plant-pollinator
communities from global change \citep[e.g.,][]{ramos2012topological,
  kaiser2010robustness}, but our limited understanding of the assembly
of these communities impedes making such predictions
\citep{Vazquez2009, Burkle2011}. Unlike in the broader food web
literature, we have few mechanistic models of mutualistic network
assembly \citep{valdovinos2013adaptive}. In addition, the few that
have been developed often borrow their mechanisms from competitive
interactions, leading to inaccurate biological assumptions
\citep{holland2006comment}. We need further development of mechanistic
models of mutualistic system to generate testable predictions, along
with empirical exploration of network assembly. Plant-pollinator
communities and mutualisms in general are vital for the maintenance of
biodiversity and the provision of essential ecosystem services. We
must therefore understand the processes underlying their assembly to
facilitate restoration and conservation.

% Communities assembling through preferential attachment are formed by a

% are being added to the community. However, our changing point analysis
% results show that there is a critical reorganization in the

% in nestedness through time, specialization did not
% increase. Furthermore, this increase in nestedness could be explained

% Evidence indicates that there is a positive relationship between

% \subsection*{Core and peripherial communities}

% To classify species as we first generate dendrograms using the GHRG
% model before and after each change point.  We then determined which
% species belonged to the ``core'' and ``peripheral'' network
% communities at each site. The ``core'' network communities contain the
% majority of species and are more basil than the more derived, less
% specious ``peripheral'' network communities. We next use a
% Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA)
% \citep{anderson-2013-557} to determine whether the species
% compositions of the species that belonged to the core and peripheral
% communities differed. We also test whether core or peripheral species
% had more variability in their species compositions \citep[i.e.,
% multivariate dispersion][]{anderson-2011-19, anderson-2006-683}.

% Lastly, we explored the functional diversity of the core and
% peripheral pollinator species

% The syrphids in our study area have similar traits, so we focused on
% the trait diversity of the bee subset of our interaction networks. We
% focus on resource capture and use traits that collectively
% \citep{kremen-2015-602} including resource specialization
% \citep[quantitative, $d'$;][]{bluthgen-2006-9}, body size
% \citep[quantitative, inter-tegular span, mm,][]{cane-1987-145},
% sociality (categorical: eusocial, solitary, cleptoparasitic), nest
% location (categorical: above ground, below ground or mix), and nest
% construction \citep[categorical: excavator, mason or
% renter;][]{williams-2010-2280} as described in more detail in
% \cite{kremen-2015-602}.  Each trait has the same weight in trait
% diversity metric estimation \citep{villeger-2008-2290,
% schleuter-2010-469}.

% To characterize the functional diversity of the bee species in core
% and peripherial communities, we computed three metrics that capture
% diversity, uniqueness, and distribution of functional values in the
% community: functional dispersion, divergence, and evenness
% \citep{villeger-2008-2290, schleuter-2010-469}.  Functional
% dispersion is a measure of trait diversity, corrected for species
% richness \citep{schleuter-2010-469}; functional divergence measures
% how species abundances are distributed within the trait space
% \citep[i.e., a measure of functional
% uniqueness,][]{villeger-2008-2290}; functional evenness measures the
% regularity with which traits are distributed across functional
% space, accounting for abundance \citep{villeger-2008-2290}.  In
% combination, these metrics provide a relatively complete overview of
% the different aspects of functional diversity
% \citep{villeger-2008-2290, schleuter-2010-469}. To determine whether
% trait evenness, dispersion, and divergence differed between controls
% and hedgerows at different stages of maturation, we used the trait
% diversity metrics as response variables in linear mixed models with
% site type as a fixed effect and year and site as random effects
% \citep{lme4,lmetest}.
